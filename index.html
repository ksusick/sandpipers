    <h1>Sandpipers</h1>

    <p>Sandpipers and Allies (Scolopacidae) consist of 34 different bird species that share a common ancestery and
      similar behaviors and habitats. They prefer shorelines such as coastal sandflats or wetlands, including estuaries
      and lakes. Sandpipers forage in mud, sand, or soil in search of invertebrates and other small prey.

      <h2>Similar-looking Sandpipers of California </h2>
      <p>Species of Scolopacidae can be difficult to distinguish from one another because they may
        have similar body and bill shapes. In addition, its likely that they are being viewed from a distance
        as they feed along the shoreline, or are in flight. Listed below and briefly described are five relatively
        large-bodied members of Scolopacidae found in California that might be confused for one another yet can be told
        apart by certain distinct attributes if observed more carefully. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Long-billed Dowitcher</li>
        <li>Willet</li>
        <li>Marbled Godwit</li>
        <li>Whimbrel</li>
        <li>Long-billed Curlew</li>

      <h3>Long-billed Dowitcher</h3>
      <img src="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/479518431-240px.jpg" alt="picture of Long-billed Dowitcher" width="214" height="161">

      <p>The Long-billed Dowitcher (<em>Limnodromus scolopaceus</em>) is the smallest of the sandpipers listed here, but
        has mottled gray winter plummage like the others and a stilt-like appearance. (The Short-billed
        Dowitcher isn't included in this list but they and the Long-billed Dowitcher were at one time considered the
        same
        species.) This species prefers fresh-water marshes and uses its straight long bill to feed on insects and aquatic invertebrates. A cool fact
        about the Long-billed Dowitcher is that their bills contain a high number of tactile receptors for locating
        prey.
        Its current status on the conservation watch list is least concern.

      <h3>Willet</h3>
      <img src="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/64838111-240px.jpg" alt="picture of Willet"
        width="214" height="161">
      <p>The Willet (<em>Tringa semipalmata</em>) prefers coastal shoreline and saltwater marshes during winter where it feeds primarily on
        crabs and other marine invertebrates. It has a straight bill like the Dowitcher but it is shorter and uses it differently by
        feeding at the surface. A cool fact about the Willet is that when a predator approaches a nest it will pretend
        to
        have a broken wing to lure it away. Its current status on the conservation watch list is least concern with
        populations <strong>declining</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Marbled Godwit</h3>
      <img src="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/64811431-240px.jpg" alt="picture of Marbled Godwit"
        width="214" height="161">

      <p>The Marbled Godwit (<em>Limosa fedoa</em>) has a sword-shaped bill that is slightly upturned, and is a good way for viewers to distinguish this bird from other sandpipers. It uses its bill to pierce deep into mudflats and sand to find aquatic
        invertebrates, vegetation, and even small fish. Its wintering grounds are coastal shoreline, including tidal flats of
        estuaries. A cool fact about the Marbled Godwit is that most populations breed in the northern Great Plains and
        feed mainly on plant tubers during migration. Its current status on
        the conservation watch list is least concern with populations <strong>declining</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Whimbrel</h3>
      <img src="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/301232671-480px.jpg" alt="picture of Whimbrel"
        width="214" height="161">

      <p>The Whimbrel (<em>Numenius phaeopus</em>) has a similar slender body shape and winter plummage to the Marbled
        Godwit, but can easily be distinguished by its long, down-curved bill. Whimbrels feed mosly on aquatic crabs
        and
        other marine invertebrates along tidal flats as wintering grounds. This includes estuaries and saltmarshes as well as rocky intertidal. A cool fact about the Whimbrel is
        that it has a migration route that stretches from nesting grounds in the Artic to as far south as South America
        during winter. Its current status on
        the conservation watch list is least concern with populations <strong>declining</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Long-billed Curlew</h3>
      <img src="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/64810681-480px.jpg" alt="picture of Long-billed Curlew" width="214"
        height="161">

      <p>The Long-billed Curlew (<em>Numenius americanus</em>) has an even longer curved bill than the Whimbrel. It is
        the
        largest shorebird of North America (Herons and egrets aren't considered shorebirds). It uses its incredibly long
        bill to probe for marine invertebrates like crustaceans and insects along coastal mudflats including estuaries
        and
        marshes during winter. A cool fact about Long-billed Curlews is that its genus name, <em>Numenius</em>, means “of the new
        moon,”
        appropriately describing its slender, curved bill. Its current
        status on the conservation watch list is least concern.</p>
